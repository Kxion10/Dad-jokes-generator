# Dad-jokes-generator

This program asks the user if they want to hear 4 dad jokes and displays them if you enter "yes".

After displaying the jokes, the program will ask if you want to keep hearing more, if so the generator will keep deisplaying jokes till you no longer wish to hear dad jokes.

If you no longer wish to hear dad jokes, the program tells you how many it has read to you and closes.

The jokes are pulled from an array that contains all the jokes.
